# OpenSalve

A disaster-relief management webapp.

This is a project done for [Excel HackForTomorrow 24 hour hackathon](http://hackfortomorrow.excelmec.org/).

This is just a prototype. Some features won't work.

## Description

We made a website to help relief efforts. There was a flood in my native place Alappuzha which affected a lot of people and one of the key problem in any sudden natural disaster is that the coordination is not the best and the general public don't know how the government is handling the supplies and things. So we created a webapp that can be used by govs or NGOs to handle relief efforts and show them to public which increases transparency and reduce corruption.

By doing this, the coordination can be improved and will motivate the public to donate more to help the relief-efforts.
